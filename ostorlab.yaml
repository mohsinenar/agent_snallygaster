    This repository is an implementation of [Ostorlab Agent](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) for the [snallygaster tool](https://github.com/hannob/snallygaster).  
    ## Getting Started  
    To perform your first scan, simply run the following command:  
    ```shell  
    ostorlab scan run --install --agent agent/mohsinenar/snallygasterdomain-name sub.domain.com  
    ```  
    ## Installation & Usage  
      
      
     ### Install directly from ostorlab agent store  
     ```shell  
     ostorlab agent install agent/mohsinenar/snallygaster 
     ```  
    You can then run the agent with the following command:  
    ```shell  
    ostorlab scan run --agent agent/mohsinenar/snallygasterdomain-name sub.domain.com  
    ```  
    ### Build directly from the repository  
     1. To build the nmap agent you need to have [ostorlab](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine.  if you have already installed ostorlab, you can skip this step.  
    ```shell  
    pip3 install ostorlab  
    ```  
     2. Clone this repository.  
    ```shell  
    git clone https://github.com/mohsinenar/agent_dns_reaper.git && cd agent_snallygaster 
    ```  
     3. Build the agent image using ostorlab cli.  
     ```shell  
     ostortlab agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml  
     ```  
     You can pass the optional flag `--organization` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.  
     4. Run the agent using on of the following commands:  
       * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:  
        ```shell  
        ostorlab scan run --agent agent//snallygasterip 8.8.8.8  
        ```  
       * If you specified an organization when building the image:  
        ```shell  
        ostorlab scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/snallygasterip 8.8.8.8  
        ```
